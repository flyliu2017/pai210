# REST Server

REST Server exposes a set of interface that allows you to manage jobs.

## Quick Start

1. Job config file

    Prepare a job config file as described in [examples/README.md](../job-tutorial/README.md#json-config-file-for-job-submission), for example, `exampleJob.json`.

2. Authentication

    HTTP POST your username and password to get an access token from:
    ```
    http://restserver/api/v1/token
    ```
    For example, with [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), you can execute below command line:
    ```sh
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
         -X POST http://restserver/api/v1/token \
         -d "username=YOUR_USERNAME" -d "password=YOUR_PASSWORD"
    ```

3. Submit a job

    HTTP PUT the config file as json with access token in header to:
    ```
    http://restserver/api/v1/jobs/exampleJob
    ```
    For example, you can execute below command line:
    ```sh
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
         -X PUT http://restserver/api/v1/jobs/exampleJob \
         -d @exampleJob.json
    ```

4. Monitor the job

    Check the list of jobs at:
    ```
    http://restserver/api/v1/jobs
    ```
    Check your exampleJob status at:
    ```
    http://restserver/api/v1/jobs/exampleJob
    ```
    Get the job config JSON content:
    ```
    http://restserver/api/v1/jobs/exampleJob/config
    ```
    Get the job's SSH info:
    ```
    http://restserver/api/v1/jobs/exampleJob/ssh
    ```

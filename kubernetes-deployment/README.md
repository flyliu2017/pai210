# Kubernetes Deployment in cluster

This document explains how to deploy Kubernetes in a cluster. We assume each node in the cluster has a statically assigned IP and runs Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
The following k8s components will be deployed in the designated nodes and run in host network:
- kubelet
- apiserver
- controller-manager
- etcd
- scheduler
- dashboard
- kube-proxy 

Each k8s component runs in a Docker container. If Docker is missing in the OS, the script will install the latest Docker version.

## Prepare your cluster configuration

Please specify the cluster configuration in a yaml file. The [cluster-config-example.yaml](./cluster-config-example.yaml) is an example, where some detailed explanation is included.

## Kubernetes high-availability 

#### solution 1

Because cloud providers such as azure always have the load balance service. So when deploy pai to the cloud platform, you could chose the load-balance service to implement the high-availability.

Before bootstrap your kubernetes cluster, you should configure your load-balance. please set the backend with your master. And set the following property with the ip of the load-balance.

```yaml

api-servers-ip: load-balance IP

```

#### solution 2

If your environment don't have a load-balance service. You could add proxy node to the kuebrnetes cluster. And then implement the load-balance component to the cluster. 

Please add all the configuration or template to the following place. here we use haproxy as an example. Feel free to implement your own load-balance component.
```yaml
component_list:
  haproxy:
  - src: haproxy.yaml
    dst: src/etc/kubernetes/manifests
  - src: haproxy.cfg
    dst: src/haproxy
    
remote_deployment:
  proxy:
    listname: proxymachinelist
    component:
    - name: kubelet
    - name: haproxy
``` 

And then set the proxy node in the following place.
```yaml

proxymachinelist:

  proxy-01:
    nodename: IP
    hostip: IP
    username: username
    password: password


```

And then set the following property with the ip or vip of your load-balance.

```yaml

api-servers-ip: load-balance IP or VIP

```

#### solution 3

Not enable kubernete-ha. 
please comment following code in cluster-config.
```yaml
component_list:
  haproxy:
  - src: haproxy.yaml
    dst: src/etc/kubernetes/manifests
  - src: haproxy.cfg
    dst: src/haproxy
    
remote_deployment:
  proxy:
    listname: proxymachinelist
    component:
    - name: kubelet
    - name: haproxy
    
proxymachinelist:

  proxy-01:
    nodename: IP
    hostip: IP
    username: username
    password: password

```

## Cluster maintenance

Please refer to this [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/pai/wiki/Cluster-Maintenance)

## Prepare your dev-box environment


#### Host Environment
Make sure your dev box has full network access to the cluster.

Python(2.x) and lib install:
```yaml
sudo apt-get install python python-paramiko python-yaml python-jinja2
sudo pip install python-etcd kubernetes
```

Note: kubectl will be installed on this dev-box. So it can access to your kubernetes cluster.

#### In a docker container
- Make sure your dev box has full network access to the cluster.
- Make sure your dev box has been installed docker.
```bash
sudo docker build -t kubernetes-deployment .
sudo docker run -itd \
        -e COLUMNS=$COLUMNS -e LINES=$LINES -e TERM=$TERM \
        -v /path/to/your/cluster-configuration:/cluster-configuration  \
        -v /var/lib/docker:/varl/lib/docker \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        --pid=host \
        --privileged=true \
        --net=host \
        --name=deployment \
        kubernetes-deployment
sudo docker exec -it deployment /bin/bash
cd /pai/kubernetes-deployment
        
```



## bootstrap

```bash
sudo ./bootstrap.py -p yourclusterconfig.yaml -a deploy
```

## Destroy your cluster
```bash
sudo ./bootstrap.py -p yourclusterconfig.yaml -a clean
```

## Only install kubectl into your dev-box
```bash
sudo ./bootstrap.py -p yourclusterconfig.yaml -a install_kubectl
```

## Add new nodes to your cluster
```bash
sudo ./bootstrap.py -p yourclusterconfig.yaml -f yournodelist.yaml -a add
```

## Remove nodes from your cluster
```bash
sudo ./bootstrap.py -p yourclusterconfig.yaml -f yournodelist.yaml -a remove
```


## Repair the worker node with the unhealthy states
```bash
sudo ./bootstrap.py -p yourclusterconfig.yaml -f yournodelist.yaml -a repair
```

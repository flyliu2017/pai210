# Deploying Services On Kubernetes

This document explains how to use Kubernetes to deploy system services, including framework launcher, hadoop, rest server, and web portal. 

## Prerequisite

Python and Docker are required in the dev box.

Python(2.x) and the lib to install:
```
sudo apt-get install python python-pip python-yaml python-jinja2 
sudo pip install kubernetes
```

[Docker install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

The deployment process further relies on a Docker registry service (e.g., [Docker hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/)) to store the docker images for the services to be deployed.

## Prepare hadoop configuration (patching)

```
sudo ./prepare_hadoop_config.sh
```

According to your environment, you can customize the hadoop configuration in this step.

## Cluster configuration and script generation

Please specify the cluster configuration in a yaml file. The file [clusterconfig-example.yaml](./clusterconfig-example.yaml) illustrates such an example, where some detailed explanation is included.
When deploying services to your cluster, please replace the specified fields with your own configuration.


## Build docker image

```
sudo ./docker_build.py -p your-cluster-config.yaml
```

## Deploying services on k8s

Run the following command:
```
sudo ./deploy.py -d -p your-cluster-config.yaml
```

## Cleanup your previous deployment

```
sudo ./deploy.py -p your-cluster-config.yaml
sudo ./cleanup-service.py
```

## For advanced user: Customize or re-config hadoop service

Before reconfiguration, please use k8s to stop hadoop service and remove the hadoop configmap. 
User can customize hadoop configuration in ./bootstrap/hadoop-service/hadoop-configuration/ (configuration files are generated by ./prepare_hadoop_config.sh).
After making the necessary changes to the configuration, please run 
```
./bootstrap/hadoop-service/start.sh
```

## For developer: how to add or remove service to the cluster?

Create a folder with the name of the new service, put all your files of the docker image in the folder, put it in the path ./src/,
and add the detail of the service in the servicelist section in [service.yaml](service.yaml).

#### The folder structure
```
service-deployment 
|
+-----bootstrap
|       |
|       +------ folder with service name    (the name in the service.yaml)
|
+-----src
|       |
|       +------folder with customized image name    (the name in the service.yaml)
|
+------deploy.py   (The script to bootstrap service in the cluster)
|
+------docker_build.py (The script to build all the customized docker image and push them to the docker registry)
|
+------clusterconfig-example.yaml  (the config of the cluster)
|
+------service.yaml ( the list and information of the  service in the cluster. The list of customized docker image)
|
+------readmd.md
```

#### Service.yaml

After you finish adding information of your service to [service.yaml](service.yaml) and put your files in the corresponding path,  run deploy.py and your service will start up.

If you want to remove some default services, just comment them in [service.yaml](service.yaml) before running deploy.py.

#### Template

All templates will be instantiated by [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/).
And all the information is retrieved from clusterconfig (as in [clusterconfig-example.yaml](clusterconfig-example.yaml)).
If your service need more information, please add your property to cluster config. 
The new property should be placed in clusterinfo, machineinfo or machinelist.

#### Deploy/Test a single service 

- ```sudo ./prepare_hadoop_config.sh```

Prepare hadoop configuration. If you are not sure whether your service depends on it or not. Please don't skip this step.


- ```sudo ./docker_build â€“p clusterconfig -n your_image_name```

To ensure your docker image could be built successfully.


- ```sudo ./deploy -p clusterconfig -d -s your_service_name```

To ensure your service could be start up correctly.

- ```sudo ./bootstrap/service/clean.sh```

To ensure your service could be stopped correctly with  stop script. This script is the stop script in the service.yaml where you configured.
